Explain the importance of setting up a development environment:

    Isolation: It ensures that your development environment is isolated from your production environment, preventing changes that might affect the live system.
    Consistency: Provides a consistent environment for all developers, ensuring that the code behaves the same way on every developer's machine.
    Dependency Management: Manages dependencies and configurations specific to development, making it easier to track and control changes.
    Testing: Facilitates initial testing and debugging before code is pushed to staging or production environments.
    Efficiency: Streamlines the workflow, allowing developers to quickly spin up and tear down environments as needed.
